Greetings :)

I am Indranil Saha, a keen aspiring VLSI Enthusiast.
Welcome to my "30 DAYS OF RTL" repository. Here you can have view of my self challenge taken to learn, practice and improve "Register Transfer Level" i.e. RTL Coding and to gain gradual greater insights into Digital System Design and HDL.

Combinational,Sequential,Memories and FSM Verilog Coding


Simulation Tool: MODELSIM
